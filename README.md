## Contribute

Do you want to contribute, report a bug or introduce a new feature? Sure why not!\
Just take a second to look at some basic rules I will go by when deciding whether to merge something or not.

- Does it fix a bug?
- Will the change make Highway more complicated than it really needs to be?
- Does it improve Highway on other platforms? (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Will the change break anything?
- Will the change reduce the size of Highway?
- Is the change really necessary?

That's it! You are all set up to contribute :arrow_down: :arrow_down:
